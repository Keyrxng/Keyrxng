### üöÄ Software I Authored for UbiquityOS

Check my **pinned repositories** for more details on these projects!

- **[rpc-handler](https://github.com/Keyrxng/web3-rpc-racer-1)** - *RPC Handler NPM Package.* A Web3-focused TS npm package supporting 100s-1000s of chains, explorers, and RPC providers. Dynamically selects the lowest latency provider and exposes an `Ethers.JsonRpcProvider` proxy with internal retry and reselect logic. Has been in production for nearly a year with zero faults‚Äîone of my proudest creations!
- **[ubiquity-os-kernel-telegram](https://github.com/ubq-testing/telegram--bot)** - *A hybrid Cloudflare Worker & GitHub Actions plugin.* This plugin bridges UbiquityOS with Telegram, leveraging CF for quick responses, and actions for a node runtime and long running execution with nil cost. It powers the `Workrooms` feature, which creates and manages Telegram chats for GitHub tasks, while also handling DM notifications like disqualifications, reviews, payments, and follow-ups. Additionally, it integrates `command-ask` to support a Telegram-based chatbot.
- **[ubiquity-os-plugin-installer](https://github.com/ubq-testing/ubiquity-os-plugin-installer)** - *A GUI to install UbiquityOS plugins.* A vanilla TypeScript & CSS app that allows users to install and configure UbiquityOS' kernel plugins from the marketplace. Worked extensively with strict schema validation, deconstruction, and input rendering using Typebox & AJV. Integrated with GitHub to push configurations directly to the intended source.
- **[command-ask](https://github.com/ubq-testing/ask-plugin)** - *A GitHub-integrated AI chatbot.* I authored V1 and V2, establishing its foundational structure. It's highly context-aware of conversational history in issues/PRs and their linked discussions. While it has evolved with additional features, having authored multiple versions and the bulk of the logic I still feel a sense of 'ownership'.
- **[dao-analytics](https://github.com/ubiquity-os/dao-analytics)** - *A plugin & UI for GitHub org analytics.* Collects and visualizes contributions, average task durations, and other key productivity metrics. I proposed and developed this to help the DAO explore monetization opportunities through analytical insights.
- All of the above I authored from the ground up. While there is more I could list, these are the contributions I consider most impactful.

### üìà Some of My Other Impacts at UbiquityOS

- **200+ merged PRs** into production software.
- **Progressed from open-source contributor to flagship product lead in under a year.**
- **Promoted again within 2 months** of leadership.
- **Ran the most successful talent onboarding & recruitment initiative** since the company's inception‚Äîbeginner's luck or a natural?
- **Ubiquitous in the company's ecosystem, quite literally.** I worked across so many business areas that I practically embodied the name UbiquityOS.

### üîç Looking Ahead

- Despite transitioning out due to communication challenges, I continue contributing in my spare time. I'm currently **seeking a new opportunity** to build cool stuff and thrive in an environment where I can grow and belong.
