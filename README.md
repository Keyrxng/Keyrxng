How's it going? - I'm a self-taught engineer still sanding rough edges off how I build and communicate. I tend to pick up unloved, flaky, or ambiguous corners and try to make them quiet and boring. Plenty left to learn; my content pieces are as much field notes for future me as they are for anyone else.

## Now / Active Surfaces

- Writing
- Rust
- AI Context pipelines ([Cortex](https://github.com/Keyrxng/Cortex))
- Open to new work 

## Writing

1. Origin inflection — [My first commit](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/anvil-custom-rpc-ui) → anxiety to action.
2. Stretch risk — [The merge that changed everything](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/production-safe-uups) (UUPS, audit survival).
3. Discipline — [Context engineering](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/context-engineering) (moving beyond prompt tinkering and writing retrospectives).
4. Temporality in vector-space — [The Ghost's footprint](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/ghost-in-the-machine-part-1) (mine).
5. 12-Factor Agents — [Why I like them](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/12-factor-agents)
