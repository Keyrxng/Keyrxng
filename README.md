How's it going? - I'm a self-taught engineer still sanding rough edges off how I build and communicate. I tend to pick up unloved, flaky, or ambiguous corners (types, tests, RPCs, context pipelines) and try to make them quiet and boring. Plenty left to learn; the essays are as much field notes for future me as they are for anyone else.

## Now / Active Surfaces

- Writing (shipping essay chains instead of polishing drafts forever)
- Rust (systems ergonomics & async boundaries)
- Context pipelines (LLM token budgeting + temporality applied pragmatically)
- Type subtraction patterns (precomputed shapes over recursive inference)
- Open to new work (reliability slices, context engineering, type architecture)

## Writing (Start Here)

1. Origin inflection — [My first commit](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/anvil-custom-rpc-ui) → anxiety to action.
2. Stretch risk — [The merge that changed everything](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/production-safe-uups) (UUPS, audit survival).
3. Discipline — [Context engineering](https://www.keyrxng.xyz/writing/context-engineering) (moving beyond prompt tinkering and retrospectives).

## Principles (Snapshot)

Subtractive first. Keep blast radius small. Make the flaky path deterministic before optimizing. Precompute shape instead of asking compilers or models to guess repeatedly. Leave headroom (time, tokens, people). Ship a thin slice, watch it under real load, then harden. Most of this is borrowed; I'm still iterating on where it breaks.
